<p> This is a relatively demanding test for the accuracy
of mathematical system functions like, sin, exp, lgamma, etc.

It consists of a group of programs, one for each function,
which can be run on a target machine and will produce a short report 
about the precision of the function in that machine.

<p>There are two main goals for producing this software:
first to understand how reliable the numerical evaluations of the
system you use are,
and secondly to provide some encouragement to the developers to
improve some areas with problems.

<p>Currently the programs are in C, but it is not difficult
to extend them to other languages.  It is also possible to use
various floating point systems.  The tests are geared to test
double precision functions.  Neither float nor long doubles are
considered.

<p>The function is basically tested over various inputs, for which
we have precomputed the result to higher precision.  These inputs
are <i>difficult</i>, in various senses.  First, a list of known
problematic values are tried.  Secondly, values which will evaluate
to problematic values are also tried.  Finally, ranges of values
are explored randomly, but for each value, <i>nasty</i> neighbours
are computed.  A nasty value is one for which the exact result will
be extremely close to 0.5 ulp.  This is done with a cute application
of the LLL lattice reduction algorithm.  By testing with these numbers
we often find the weakest approximations.

<p>The typical summary result for a function looks like:</p>

<div align=center><table border cellpadding=4>
<tr> <th>function</th>
     <th>tests</th>
     <th>max err in ulps</th>
     <th>argument (max err)</th>
     <th>value (max err)</th>
</tr>
<tr><td align=left><a href=solaris/acos.res>acos</a></td>
<td align=right>1304</td><td align=right>0.57432</td><td>
-0.875010530199998859</td><td>2.63625389482078987</td></tr>
</table></div><br>
where the function tested is <code>acos</code> (arc cosine), the test had 1304
points, and the worst error was 0.57432 ulps for the argument -0.875...
which gave 2.636... as a result.
Clicking on the function name will show the actual output of the
program for acos, which contains some more information.
In particular, the 20 worst errors are shown.  This is very helpful
to find why these errors may be happening.
(See for example <a href="axp/j0.res">j0</a> where all the problems
happen very close to the zeros.).

<p>For a result which is stored in a double precision variable (with no extra
bits or extended precision), it is impossible to achieve a result
better than 0.5 ulp (for most reasonable functions).
In practical terms, a maximum error of 0.51 ulp is a superb result,
a maximum of 0.6 ulp is a very good result, a maximum of 1 ulp is getting
to be a bit weak.

<h1>Results available</h1>
<p>Currently results are available for:

<h1>Model of computation</h1>
<p>The model of error in the computation is the standard one for
numerical analysis.  The inputs to the functions (floating point
numbers) are considered exact rationals.  The result of the function
computation is compared against the value of the function at the
exact rational.  The error is measured in ulp (units in the last
place), that is the values of the results are multiplied by a power
of the base such that an error in the last significant place is
an error of 1.

<p>Some functions in some systems suffer from very large ulp errors
for arguments which produce values close to zero.  This is still a
serious flaw in our view, but a bit more forgivable by others.

<p>We have included some special functions for reasons
explained below.</p>
<div align=center><table border cellpadding=4>
<tr> <th>name</th>
     <th>mathematical</th>
     <th>reason</th></tr>
<tr><td align=left>INV</td>
    <td align=left>1/<i>x</i></td>
    <td align=left>Testing hardware division</td>
<tr><td align=left>Pix</td>
    <td align=left>Pi <i>x</i></td>
    <td align=left>Testing hardware multiplication</td>
<tr><td align=left>pow2_x</td>
    <td align=left>2<sup><i>x</i></sup></td>
    <td align=left>the <code>pow</code> function has two arguments, test one</td>
<tr><td align=left>powx_275</td>
    <td align=left><i>x</i><sup>2.75</sup></td>
    <td align=left>the <code>pow</code> function has two arguments, test the other</td>
<tr><td align=left>Gamma</td>
    <td align=left>exp(lgamma(x))</td>
    <td align=left>the lgamma hides too much error</td>
</table></div><br>

<p>The computations are done in two ways, first they are done and
stored in a double (and we try to confuse the compiler so that
it cannot optimize it away).
Secondly they are done together with the subtraction of the largest
part of the result.  The second computation will reveal if the
accumulator of the computer has more precision than the regular
doubles.
This is reported in the full results of each function.


<h1>Surprises</h1>
<p>There are some pleasant surprises and unpleasant ones.
There are also some hardware characteristics, which will inevitably
show up in the results.

<p>The zeros of functions cause havoc to most systems.  This is
well known to be a problem and it is easy to solve by a special
approximation around the zero.  This may need a careful argument
reduction, for example for trigonometrics.  The zeros of lgamma
on the negative range and the zeros of the Bessel functions caused
havoc uniformly.

<p>``Chapeau'' (as the French would say) for solaris, without any
extra precision it gets a superb collection of results.

<p>I was surprised to find that some hardware does not round
correctly for division and multiplication.  This is the case of
the Pentium/AMD, which get very small ulp &gt; 0.5 both for
multiplication and division.  It was pointed out to me by
Rolf Strebel and Brad Lucier that this problem is really due to
double rounding, first at 80 bits then at 64.  It can be corrected
by setting the FPU control word to FPU_DOUBLE using the _FPU_SETCW macro.
With this setting, the <a href="linux64/summary.html"> results</a>
are much worse for the functions, while correct for mult/div/sqrt.

<p>The results for Pentium/AMD and Linux, outside the pitfalls,
show a very uniform good behaviour, which can be attributed to
the extra bits in the accumulator.

<h1>How it is all done</h1>
<p>If you want to try these tests on your favourite machine,
you can download the data and compile and run all the programs
under the directory <code>C</code>.

<p>If your system has <code>make</code>, then your life will
be much easier, just add the entry at the top of the makefile
in the same style as the others, name your machine appropriately
(say xxx) and run:<pre>
    setenv ARCH xxx
    make clean
    make xxx/summary.html
</pre>
and your summary file will be completely built.

<p>In all cases you should check that your system is properly
described in the file <code>float.M</code>.
A superb tool for finding about your system is
<a href="http://www.cwi.nl/~steven/enquire.html">enquire</a>.
It is very portable, will run smoothly and will give you lots
of information about your hardware and C compiler.  The file
float.M can be reconstructed from the values obtained from
enquire.  At this point you will need to have Maple to run
the program that generates all the new test files for your
particular hardware.  In this case, <code>make</code> will
still suffice (but you will have to be more patient).

<p>If you want to include a new function, this is relatively
trivial to do.  Follow the examples of any of the
<code>functname.M</code>.  The main function to be run is
<code>GenerateTestFunction</code> which has five arguments:
Maple's name of the function, language (C so far), C name
of the function, set of problematic values, set of test
ranges (you should give at least one range).  Then add your
function to the <code>results</code> part of the makefile and
run it.  That's all.

<p>The programs to be executed are a sandwich of three parts:
a header (<code>C/header.h</code>) file, a set of constants
generated by the Maple program <code>GenerateTestFunction</code>
and a trailer (<code>C/trailer.h</code>) part which contains
the executing program.
The header and the trailer are included in the Maple generated
program, which is then self-contained.
To learn more details just read the comments of the programs.

<p>To verify a single value, there is a Maple function called
<code>Check</code> in the file Check.M.  This is useful when
you suspect about a particular result and would like to know
exactly how are the argument and results represented.
Check will print the arguments and values as given and as
they will (should) be represented in the particular hardware.
It also does a backwards error analysis.

<p>The technique to find nasty values to evaluate using the
LLL lattice reduction algorithm is described in this
<a href="NastyValues.ps">note.</a>
